The app has buttons to load the login page which can be changed for any network's login page with a redirect from the login to the webtext page.
The app has a button for the user's password which needs to be changed in the MainActivity. This password button copies the user's password to the clipboard in android so it can be easily pasted into the login screen.
Finally there is a contacts button which will open the user's contacts and upon selection of a contact that contact's number will be copied to the clipboard in android again and be easily be pasted into the webpage.
The user can go back to the previous page if needed by pressing back on the device.
